I work as a multidisciplinary researcher and activist in Responsible Tech and Internet Governance since September 2023, participating in [C-PARTES](https://instagram.com/coletivo_partes) and [LAPIN](https://lapin.org.br). I was a [Youth Fellow](https://forumdainternet.cgi.br/pt-BR/youth) at CGI.br in 2020 and 2023, and a student of the [intensive course at EGI.br](https://egi.nic.br/) in 2024. My research focuses on the Internet, AI, techno-surveillance, and data governance, using my background in Computer Science to support the drafting of public policies.

In 2024, I am a researcher at the [Oscar Sala Chair](http://www.iea.usp.br/pesquisa/catedras-e-convenios/catedra-oscar-sala/titular-catedra/virgilio-almeida/projeto-ia-responsavel) at USP and at the [Center for AI and Digital Policy](https://www.caidp.org/global-academic-network/ai-policy-clinic/), where I study AI policy frameworks and propose improvements to local documents.

Outside the professional sphere, I enjoy yoga, meditation, [cats](https://instagram.com/sleepycatlua), and functional beverages.
